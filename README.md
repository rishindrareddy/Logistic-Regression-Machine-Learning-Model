# Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model

A simple logistic regression model, application on a dataset to address overfitting and underfitting of data.

In this experiment, we: 
1. implement cost and gradient descent function for logistic regression to fit in with training data.
2. optimize the parameters using octave built in functions.
3. achieved accuracy of 89.05% (expected accuracy: 89.1%)
